Open powershell and set directory to the downloaded file.

After that, run the following commands: 
docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/southern-zone-latest.osm.pbf

docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-partition /data/southern-zone-latest.osrm

docker run -t -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-customize /data/southern-zone-latest.osrm

After creating these files, we had to clone the vroom-docker.

Now you need to change the left part in osrm volumes to the path you have created your osrm data. Leave the right part as it is(/data) in docker-compose.yml file.

Also change the zone name in command: field

After this, you can start your vroom instance with docker-compose up -d

select all the osrm map and paste in separate folder named as osrm.
